# Dispersion for DFT

## Dispersion Energy

The dispersion energy is

- a long-ranged (C6/R^6) electron correlation effect.
- continously becomes part of the normal correlation energy for short/medium e-e distances
- London part is not included in standard KS-DFT
- time-independent

## Why is standard KS-DFT wrong?

- Flucutations to virtual orbitals are not included
- For large R between the fragments rho approx 0
- rho does not contain signmificant dispersion signatures

$$E_{int}=E_{pauli-rep}+E_{ES}+E_{pol}+E_{disp.,short}+E_{London}$$

## What are London Dispersion Forces?

The London dispersion force is a temporary attractive force that results when the electrons in two adjacent atoms occupy postions that make the atoms form tempory dipoles.
They are attractive forces that cause nonpolar substances to condense to liquids and to freeze to solids when the temperature is lowered.
A second atom can in turn be distored by the appearance of a dipole in the first atom or molecule which leads to an electrostatic attraction.

### LD and Molecular Size

Dispersion forces are present between all molecules, whether they are polar or nonpolar.

- Large and heavier atoms and molecules exhibit stronger dispersion forces thn lighter ones
- In a large atom or moleculae, the valence electrons are on average, farther from nuclei than the small atom or molecule.  They are less tightly held and more easily form temporary dipoles.
- The ease with which the electron distribution around an atom or molecular can be distorted is called the polarizability.
